# Data Visualization – Career and Technology Trends in Developer Survey

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a developer survey dataset to uncover trends in career roles, compensation, technology preferences, and daily programming activities.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical data analysis, data cleaning, and data visualization skills using Python.

The analysis transforms raw survey responses into meaningful insights through structured data preparation and clear, user-friendly visualizations.

---

## Project Objectives

* Analyze respondent roles and demographic distribution
* Explore total compensation trends across age groups
* Examine time spent searching for solutions and answering questions
* Identify popular databases developers wish to learn
* Present insights using clear and modern data visualizations

---

## Dataset

The dataset is based on a global developer survey containing responses related to:

* Career roles
* Age and experience
* Compensation
* Technology preferences
* Daily programming activities

**Note:**
The CSV dataset is not included in this repository due to large file size.

## Tools and Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas for data manipulation
* Matplotlib for visualization
* SQLite for structured data storage
* Jupyter Notebook for analysis workflow

---

## Data Analysis Workflow

1. Loaded survey dataset into Pandas
2. Created SQLite database and queried structured data
3. Cleaned missing and invalid values
4. Converted categorical responses into numeric scales
5. Performed exploratory data analysis
6. Generated multiple visualization types
7. Interpreted and documented insights

---

## Key Visualizations

* **Histogram:** Distribution of total compensation
* **Bubble Plot:** Time spent searching vs frustration factors
* **Pie Chart:** Top databases respondents wish to learn
* **Stacked Bar Chart:** Median time spent searching vs answering
* **Line Chart:** Median compensation trend across age groups
* **Horizontal Bar Chart:** Distribution of respondent roles

---

## Key Insights

* Most survey participants are professional developers
* PostgreSQL is the most desired database to learn next year
* Developers spend more time searching for solutions than answering questions
* Median compensation increases slightly with senior age groups
* Professional developers form the largest respondent group
